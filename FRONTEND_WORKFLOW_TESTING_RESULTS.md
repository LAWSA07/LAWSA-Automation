   - Connect nodes by dragging from output to input handles
   - Configure nodes with API keys and settings

3. **Configure Nodes**
   - **Input Node:** No configuration needed
   - **Tavily Search Node:** Add Tavily API key, query template, number of results
   - **LLM Node:** Select provider, model, add API key, configure parameters
   - **Output Node:** No configuration needed

4. **Execute Workflows**
   - Click "Run Workflow" button
   - System validates all required fields
   - Results displayed in execution output panel

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### Frontend Components Updated
- ✅ `Sidebar.tsx` - Added Tavily search node
- ✅ `NodeConfigPanel.tsx` - Added Tavily search configuration
- ✅ `WorkflowEditor.tsx` - Added validation and execution
- ✅ `api.ts` - Added executeRealWorkflow method
- ✅ All node types properly configured

#### Backend Integration
- ✅ Authentication system working
- ✅ Workflow storage working
- ✅ Workflow execution working

### 📝 API Endpoints Verified

- ✅ `POST /auth/register` - User registration
- ✅ `POST /auth/login` - User login
- ✅ `GET /health` - Health check
- ✅ `POST /api/workflows` - Save workflow
- ✅ `GET /api/workflows` - Get workflows
- ✅ `GET /api/workflows/{id}` - Get specific workflow
- ✅ `POST /execute-real` - Execute workflow

### 🎉 Conclusion

**The frontend workflow creation system is fully functional and ready for users!**

Users can now:
- ✅ Create workflows with LLM and web search nodes
- ✅ Provide API keys through the frontend interface
- ✅ Execute workflows and see results
