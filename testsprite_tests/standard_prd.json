    "prepared_by": "Generated by TestSprite"
  },
  "product_overview": "A dynamic no-code automation platform that enables users to visually design, configure, and execute complex agentic workflows using LLMs, tools, and memory components. It supports secure credential management and real-time execution streaming, empowering non-technical users and automation engineers to build advanced agentic systems without coding.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Enable users to create and execute complex agentic workflows visually without programming.",
    "Provide secure credential management and validation for LLMs, tools, and memory backends.",
    "Support integrations with multiple LLM providers and a dynamic tool registry for extensibility.",
    "Offer real-time streaming of workflow execution results to enhance user feedback.",
    "Ensure production-ready security including authentication, authorization, encryption, and rate limiting."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "Visual Workflow Editor with drag-and-drop node-based UI for building agentic workflows.",
    "Dynamic backend translating workflows into LangGraph/LangChain agents for execution.",
    "Support for multiple node types including agentic, tool, model, memory, input, and output nodes.",
    "Credential management APIs and UI with Fernet encryption for secure storage and validation.",
    "Integration with various tools including email (SMTP), Slack, web search (Tavily), and math operations.",
    "Real-time streaming of agentic workflow execution results using server-sent events.",
    "Authentication and authorization with JWT for secure multi-user management.",
    "Dynamic MongoDB connection support for optional memory and persistence.",
    "Robust validation and error handling across frontend and backend to ensure workflow integrity."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "User logs in and accesses the visual workflow editor to create or modify workflows by adding and connecting nodes.",
    "User configures nodes with necessary parameters such as LLM provider credentials, tools, and memory options.",
    "User securely manages credentials via the credential management interface, validating API keys before use.",
    "User executes a workflow and views streaming real-time results of the agentic system output on the frontend.",
    "Admins manage users, credentials, and access control settings to govern platform usage and security.",
    "Developers extend the platform by adding new node types and integrating additional tools or LLM providers."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "Users can successfully create and connect multiple node types in the workflow editor with proper validation feedback.",
    "Backend builds and executes the agentic workflows dynamically reflecting the frontend configurations.",
    "Credentials are encrypted, stored securely, and validated prior to workflow execution.",
    "Streaming of execution results to the frontend works reliably with minimal latency.",
    "JWT-based authentication and authorization mechanisms enforce user access and permissions.",
    "No sensitive credentials or secrets are exposed in the code repository.",
    "The system conforms to security best practices ready for production deployment."
