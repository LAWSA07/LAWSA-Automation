# Product Specification: No-Code Agentic Automation Platform

## 1. Product Overview
A dynamic, no-code automation platform inspired by n8n, enabling users to visually design, configure, and execute complex agentic workflows. The system leverages LangGraph and LangChain to construct and run agentic systems, supporting integration with multiple LLM providers, tools, and secure credential management.

## 2. Problem Statement
Non-technical users and automation engineers need a way to build, test, and deploy advanced agentic workflows without writing code. Existing solutions are either too rigid or require programming knowledge. This platform democratizes agentic automation by providing a visual, drag-and-drop interface and a dynamic backend that translates user intent into executable agentic systems.

## 3. Key Features
- **Visual Workflow Editor**: Drag-and-drop node-based UI using React Flow.
- **Dynamic Agentic Backend**: Translates frontend workflows into LangGraph/LangChain agents.
- **Credential Management**: Secure storage and validation using Fernet encryption.
- **Multi-Provider LLM Support**: Integrations for OpenAI, Groq, Anthropic, Together, etc.
- **Tool and Memory Integration**: Add tools, memory, and custom logic as nodes.
- **Real-Time Streaming**: Server-Sent Events for live agent output.
- **Validation & Error Handling**: Robust frontend/backend validation and feedback.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: JWT-based user management.
- **Dynamic MongoDB Connection**: Secure, runtime-configurable database connections.
- **Production-Ready Security**: CORS, secrets management, and rate limiting (optional).

## 4. User Stories
- As a user, I can visually design workflows by connecting nodes representing triggers, LLMs, tools, and memory.
- As a user, I can securely store and validate API keys and credentials.
- As a user, I can execute workflows and see real-time results.
- As an admin, I can manage users and control access to workflows and credentials.
- As a developer, I can extend the platform with new node types and integrations.

## 5. Technical Requirements
- **Frontend**: React, React Flow, TanStack Query, custom node components, error handling, and validation UI.
- **Backend**: FastAPI, LangGraph, LangChain, modular architecture, dependency injection, Fernet encryption, MongoDB, JWT auth, CORS, and streaming endpoints.
- **Testing**: Pytest for backend, TestSprite for automated test coverage.
- **DevOps**: GitHub secret scanning, .env management, and clean repository practices.

## 6. Acceptance Criteria
- Users can create, connect, and configure nodes in the frontend.
- Backend dynamically builds and executes agentic workflows based on frontend input.
- Credentials are encrypted and validated before use.
- Real-time execution results are streamed to the frontend.
- No secrets are present in the repository or git history.
- System is ready for production deployment with security best practices.

## 7. Out of Scope
- Docker/containerization (for now)
- Advanced analytics and monitoring
- Marketplace for third-party nodes (future)

## 8. Future Enhancements
- Containerized deployment
- Node marketplace and plugin system
- Advanced analytics and workflow monitoring
- Team collaboration features
